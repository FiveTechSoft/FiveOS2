                      ===============================


  We really thank you for your support and suggestions (and code!) through
                       this Beta period of FiveOS2.

 Version 0E
 ==========

* A lot of classes from FiveWin have been ported into FiveOS2:
  TGet, TSay, TButton...

* New samples!

* A lot of new stuff!


 Version 0D
 ==========

* Browses are running. We really high compatible with FiveWin browses!

* Timers are done!



 Version 0C
 ==========

* We have been developing all controls creation from source code. See
  SAMPLES\TestDlg1.prg for a full sample.

* See SAMPLES\CLients.prg for the first bussiness application sample
  we are developing. See Clients.rc as a very good sample for understanding
  how to use resources in OS2.

* We are working on browses and printing. Those are just the missing parts
  to nearly start delivering FiveOS2 vers. 1.0.

* We are looking for a good routine to read bitmaps from disk dinamically,
  so we may offer the same functionality as FiveWin. Would you help us ?

* We would like to find a full working sample of folder-book controls.
  Any help will be great!

* We are almost ready to start directly porting big parts of FiveWin. The
  Five OOPS architecture is the perfect base to do it! See RadMenu.prg
  and Radio.prg for a 100% ported code from FiveWin!
